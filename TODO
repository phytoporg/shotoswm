NOTES:
- Things *just* got up and running. This is a bare-bones implementation, 100% yoinked from tinywl to get started.
- In my local environment, kwin can't find inputlib for some reason, so inputs aren't working

TODO:
- Get libinput functioning properly in kwin-land
- Refactor the main file into a sort of manual unity build (#include all source files)
- Get 5D9 working in the compositor
- Reevaluate design on 5D9/5D9d/shotoswm relationships
